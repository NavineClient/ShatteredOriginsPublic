# Season 4
## Ideas
### Origins
#### Puglin Brute
* Well, currently working on a new origin. Don't know what to specifically call it but, I already know what it's going to be about. Has been requested so many times so, I'm finally doing it.
* Will have quite some really good buffs but, definently not adding where it will not burn in lava.
* Will it have increased damage? Maybe, I'm not to sure yet. We will see about it.
* Testing Stages will happen in about an hour.
### Enchantments
#### Soulbound
* Honestly, this might end up getting removed due to the fact there will be no point in killing players if they have a soulbound enchant on them.
* Has it been requested to get it removed? Fucking Yes, both players want it removed and the fucking Owner has too.
* Honestly should I remove it? Yes and no. Yes because it caused a dupe last time and no because we will have power hungry players that want to dominate the server by killing others.
