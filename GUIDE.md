# A Guide For New Players
## Player Commands
* /warp spawn (This will allow you to teleport right back to spawn if your ever lost or if your about to die. This won't be useable if your in combat with another player)
* /team create (You will be able to create your very own team with this command)
* /pay (Yeah this is pretty self explainitory)
* /tpa (This is where if you do **/tpa <username>** that will send the other player a tp request from you where if they accept it within 60 seconds, no one can move until you teleport to the other player)
* /shattered:rules (This just shows our currently updated rules)
* /warp set <name> (This will set a warp accessible to anyone at your current location)
* /warp password <warpname> <password> (If you have setup a warp and don't want anyone there, then use this to make it where only those that know the password can access it)
* /shop (This is where you can buy or sell your items with in game money)
* /origin check (This is our servers main plugin where you can check your origin out)
* /shattered:w (This is the newly made wisper command that was made due to players lying about swaping origins so we disabled the normal one so that we have proof if anyone has done something wrong, mainly used for staff problems)
* /apply (Coming Soon) [Will Send You A Clickable Link To Apply For Staff]
